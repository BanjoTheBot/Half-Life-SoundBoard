# Half-Life-SoundBoard
A simple web soundboard using HL1 SFX
Sounds taken from this [repo](https://github.com/sourcesounds/hl1) here

Will probably only ever have popular voicelines and sound effects, because theres no way I'm gonna make buttons for every single sfx there. Like anyone would need that anyway.
